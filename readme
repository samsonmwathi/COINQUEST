A game for our Computer Graphics class

Coinquest is an exciting and adventurous game in 2D where the
playerâ€™s character collects as many coins as possible while avoiding
dangerous and deadly obstacles and traps on the screen.

The character maneuvers from left to right and can jump over
obstacles. If the player hits an obstacle the game is over and the
number of coins they have collected is saved. The game is set on an
image background depicting an outdoor setting with a sky and grassy
feel.

The game will fully be developed on the C++ programing language and
its source code will be available to anybody willing to further its
features.
